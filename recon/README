This is taken verbatim from an email (originally from Richard) that Marcello
forwarded to me on June 11, 2014.

I slightly modified the folder structure to get rid of the spaces in the
filenames.

More tweaks following.


*** Under linux/fortran ***

* Added a Makefile.
* Tweaked the .f source to match the function definitions in the two .c files
  (iopenfile -> iopenfile_ and similar). With the original version the linker
  was exiting with the following errors:

  EEE_V15.o: In function `MAIN__':
  EEE_V15.f:(.text+0x60f): undefined reference to `iopenfile'
  EEE_V15.f:(.text+0x1376): undefined reference to `iread_file'
  EEE_V15.f:(.text+0x1e1c): undefined reference to `iread_file'
  EEE_V15.f:(.text+0x1ea9): undefined reference to `irewind'
  EEE_V15.f:(.text+0x2057): undefined reference to `iread_file'
